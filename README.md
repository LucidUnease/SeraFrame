# SeraFrame
A high-performance ROBLOX Module that allows for realistic animated motion in a hierarchal system of custom 'controller' objects with a high-level framework.


Few things of note:
1. This system is NOT openly useable, nor is it under any license that allows for free personal or commercial use.
2. SeraFrame is far from complete and will continue to receive updates until it is no longer supported.
3. For inquiry dm me on Instagram, Discord (any of four accounts), email me directly or send a question on my Tumblr page.
4. This system is separate from any ongoing 'ARG's' or music projects, for inquiry on those specific projects, dm me on the specified pages. Also, you shouldn't even be here. stop spying on me.
